# SteadyCam

This mod will stop players in Spectator Mode from losing Temporal Stability.

When at low Temporal Stability, it causes uncontrollable, involuntary, unstoppable loss of control of mouse, and camera position. This can cause the camera to change direction, without the player having any input, in a very jarring, and disturbing way.

After losing hours of timelapse footage, this mod has become essential, until some time that the vanilla game is fixed.
